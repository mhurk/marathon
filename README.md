# Marathon
Simulation of distribution of runners on a marathon course

What is does and does not
- Use startwaves
- Uses a normal distribution for the pace, this is not correct. Real data needed
- Assumes pace distribution is equal for all start waves. This is not correct, faster runners will start in earlier waves.
- Assumnes constant pace during the entire race. 

- generates animation of distribution over runners over the course
- Does not create a heatmap of a course (that would be cool)
