# Marathon
Simulation of distribution of runners on a marathon course.

_What is does and does not_
- Uses startwaves, total number of runners equally distributed over waves.
- Uses a normal distribution for pace, this is not correct as it is usually a bit skewed toward faster runners. Real data is needed.
- Assumes pace distribution is the same for all start waves. This is not correct, faster runners will start in earlier waves.
- Assumes all runners starts simultaneously, per wave. 
- Assumnes constant pace during the entire race.
- Generates animation of distribution over runners over the course
 
_Future improvement_
- Create a heatmap of a course, based on gpx and number of runners on a location.
